<h1>Task 1</h1>
<h4>Task:</h4>
<p>Develop a simulation of a programmable calculator according to the following
specification in a programming language of your choice and use it to solve the
test tasks further down the page.</p>

<p>The test tasks 1 and 2 must be performed.</p>

<h4>Input into the calculator:</h4>
<p>Input occurs using postfix notation (first the arguments, then the operator).
The number of required arguments depends on the operator. Arguments are whole
numbers (or parenthesized expressions, described later). For example,
<q>1 2+</q> is an application of the operator <q>+</q> on 1 and 2, which returns
3 as a result. The expression <q>1 2 3 4+*-</q> returns -13: the first operator
adds the directly preceding arguments 3 and 4, returning 7; the operator
<q>*</q> multiplies the now directly preceding arguments 2 and 7; and finally
<q>-</q> on 1 and 14.</p>

<p>Expressions in parentheses are not immediately evaluated; instead, an
operator processes them as arguments. For example, <q>(2*)</q> as an argument
of <q>@</q> is an operator itself, which multiplies an argument by 2. The
expression <q>3(2*)@</q> evaluates to <q>3 2*</q> and eventually to 6.</p>

<p>The calculator only uses integers as data (apart from parenthesized
expressions). Numbers in the respective value range are interpreted as
characters and shown on the display (ASCII characters are recommended, but
different encodings may be used). Internally, no distinction is made between
integers and characters. For example, the number 65 is displayed as <q>A</q>.
Before displaying the number <q>65</q>, it must be converted into the ASCII
values of its digits (54 and 53).</p>

<h4>Architecture:</h4>

<p>The calculator consists of the following parts:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Keypad</dt>
<dd>The keypad (= standard input) allows the input of programs and data.</dd>
<dt>Display</dt>
<dd>The display can display ASCII characters in fields arranged in 4 rows by 64
columns. These fields are numbered from 0 to 255. One of the operators can place
a character into a specific field of the display.</dd>
<dt>Stack</dt>
<dd>Expressions in postfix notation can be simply calculated using a stack: each
argument is pushed on top of the stack. Operators pop as many arguments from the
stack as necessary and push the result(s).</dd>
<dt>Input list</dt>
<dd>Contains the input that has not yet been processed. All inputs are processed
character by character in this list. Apart from direct input via the keypad of
the calculator, the operator <q>@</q> can also add new elements into this
list.</dd>
</dl>

<p>To simplify the implementation, the stack, the input list, parenthetized
expressions, integers, etc. can be limited to (sane) maximum sizes; if they are,
exceeding them must lead to an error.</p>

<h4>Operations:</h4>
<p>The semantics of the following input are predefined:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Digits <q>0</q> to <q>9</q>:</dt>
<dd>All digits in the input list directly succeeding this one are combined into
a number, which is pushed as a new item onto the stack.</dd>
<dt><q>(</q> and <q>)</q>:</dt>
<dd>The opening parenthesis effects that all input following it (until a
matching closing parenthesis) is seen as a unit, which is placed onto the stack
(e.g. as a string). Parentheses may be nested.</dd>
<dt>White space (space, tab, newline, carriage return):</dt>
<dd>These inputs are useful to split two numbers; they have no other meaning and
are ignored.</dd>
<dt>Arithmetical operators and comparison operators (<q>+</q>, <q>-</q>,
<q>*</q>, <q>/</q>, <q>%</q>, <q>&amp;</q>, <q>|</q>, <q>=</q>, <q>&lt;</q>,
<q>&gt;</q>):</dt>
<dd>These binary operators match the basic arithmetic operators (with <q>%</q>
calculating the modulus) and simple comparisons, where &amp; and | are the
logical AND and OR, respectively. These operators pop the two top elements off
the stack and push the result onto the stack. If an argument is not a number but
a parenthesized expression, or if an argument to &amp; or | is not a boolean
value (0 is <q>true</q>, 1 is <q>false</q>), an error must be reported. <q>=</q>
is an exception: if it is applied to two equal parenthesized expressions or two
equal numbers, it should return 0 (true), otherwise 1 (false). Non-commutative
operations enforce a specific argument order: <q>4 2-</q>, <q>4 2/</q> and <q>2
4%</q> all evaluate to 2, and <q>4 2&gt;</q> and <q>2 4&lt;</q> evaluate to
<q>true</q>. An error must be produced if the second argument of / or % is 0.</dd>
<dt>Negation <q>~</q></dt>
<dd>is only defined on integers.</dd>
<dt>Copy <q>!</q>:</dt>
<dd>replaces the topmost element n on the stack with a copy of the n-th element
on the stack (counting from 1 at the position of n). An error is output if n is
not a positive number or the stack doesn&#8217;t contain enough elements.</dd>
<dt>Delete <q>#</q>:</dt>
<dd>pops the topmost element n off the stack and additionally deletes the n-th
element from the stack. An error is output if n is not a positive number or the
stack doesn&#8217;t contain enough elements.</dd>
<dt>Apply <q>@</q>:</dt>
<dd>pops the topmost element off the stack. If this argument is a parenthesized
expression, the parentheses are stripped and the expression is placed to the
front of the input list, so that the input in this list is processed next. If
the argument is an integer, <q>@</q> pushes it back onto the stack without
modifying it.</dd>
<dt>Read <q>?</q>:</dt>
<dd>pops the top two elements off the stack, where one must be a non-negative
number n and the other a parenthesized expression; otherwise, an error is
output. The result, the (ASCII) code of the n-th character in the parenthesized
expression, is pushed onto the stack. If the parenthesized expression contains
fewer than n characters, -1 is placed onto the stack.</dd>
<dt>Extend <q>;</q>:</dt>
<dd>pops the top two elements off the stack, where one must be an integer
interpretable as an (ASCII) code and the other a parenthesized expression;
otherwise, an error is output. The result, the parenthesized expression with the
given character appended to the end (before the closing parenthesis), is pushed
onto the stack. Thus, the integer is interpreted as a character and appended to
the parenthesized expression.</dd>
<dt>Output <q>$</q>:</dt>
<dd>pops the top two elements off the stack, where one must be an integer
interpretable as an (ASCII) code and the other the number of a field on the
display, and stores the character in the respective field. If an argument is not
a number of out of range, an error must be output.</dd>
<dt>Controlled input mode <q>"</q>:</dt>
<dd>terminates normal input mode (where keyboard input is directly placed into
the input list) and initiates controlled input mode, where keyboard input is
placed in parenthesized expressions. When a line is terminated using Enter or
Return, the whole line (placed in parentheses) is pushed onto the stack. The
controlled input mode is useful if input is checked, preprocessed or displayed
before processing.</dd>
<dt>Normal input mode <q>'</q>:</dt>
<dd>terminates controlled input mode and returns to normal input mode.</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Examples:</h4>
<p>A few examples should illustrate the usage of the operators. We describe the
state of the calculator using the stack contents (left of the <q>^</q>,
top-of-stack is directly next to <q>^</q>, entries split by spaces) and the
input list (right of the <q>^</q>, next character to process directly next to
<q>^</q>). Arrows between such status descriptions show changes in state through
execution of operations.</p>
<p>The first example shows a conditional instruction: The stack expects 0 (true)
or 1 (false). Depending on that, either one or the other parenthesized
expression is evaluated. We first place the expression for the true branch
<q>(9)</q> and then the false branch <q>(9~)</q> onto the stack and execute the
expression <q>(4!5#2+#@)</q>, which represents the conditional expression
itself. The following steps demonstrate what happens if the stack originally
contained 0:</p>
<pre>
  0 ^(9)(9~)(4!5#2+#@)@
&#8594; 0 (9) ^(9~)(4!5#2+#@)@
&#8594; 0 (9) (9~) ^(4!5#2+#@)@
&#8594; 0 (9) (9~) (4!5#2+#@) ^@
&#8594; 0 (9) (9~) ^4!5#2+#@
&#8594; 0 (9) (9~) 4 ^!5#2+#@
&#8594; 0 (9) (9~) 0 ^5#2+#@
&#8594; 0 (9) (9~) 0 5 ^#2+#@
&#8594; (9) (9~) 0 ^2+#@
&#8594; (9) (9~) 0 2 ^+#@
&#8594; (9) (9~) 2 ^#@
&#8594; (9) ^@
&#8594; ^ 9
&#8594; 9 ^
</pre>
<p>
The next example shows, by calculating factorial-of-3, how to realize recursive
routines. For simplification purposes, we substitute the expression
(3!3!1-2!1=()5!C@3#*) by A, where C is the expression (4!5#2+#@) from the
previous example. Note that A and C are only used to facilitate readability;
the actual parenthesized expression must be input into the calculator.</p>

<h4>Test task 1:</h4>
<p>The calculator is so primitive that (apart from errors in the console when
the program aborts) no output is performed without prior programming. Write a
program in the language of the calculator, which displays the newest input into
the calculator and the topmost elements of the stack on the calculator&#8217;s
display. It is your choice how to efficiently use the limited space on the
display.</p>
<p>Practical hint: Programming (or bootstrapping) the calculator requires
inputting long and complex expressions. The easiest way to do this is input via
a text console, which allows inputting programs via copying and pasting.</p>

<h4>Test task 2:</h4>
<p>Devise a short and efficient expression in the language of the calculator,
which decides whether a number input via the keypad is a prime number or not,
and output the result in a readable form (i.e. not only as 0 or 1) on the
display. Test with multiple numbers, some of them larger (at least up to
1000).</p>

<h4>Additional tasks for those interested:</h4>
<p>The question is: can this calculator really program everything? Is it
possible to build a Turing machine using the calculator? It is not necessary to
solve these tasks and they do not affect grading.</p>
